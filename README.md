## Key Elements of a Wireframe

A wireframe serves as the skeletal framework of a website or application. It outlines the arrangement and relationship of different elements, helping teams visualize the user experience before moving into high-fidelity design. The key elements of a wireframe include:

### 1. Layout Structure
The layout structure defines the overall arrangement of elements on a page. It ensures that the design follows a logical and consistent flow.  
**Example:** A booking system might place the search bar at the top, results in the center, and filters on the left side. This structure helps users quickly find and interact with essential features.

### 2. Navigation
Navigation represents how users move through the system. It includes menus, links, and tabs that guide users to different sections.  
**Example:** A top navigation bar with links to "Home," "Bookings," "Profile," and "Support" helps users easily access key areas without confusion.

### 3. Content Placement
Content placement focuses on where text, images, and other information will appear within the interface. Proper placement improves readability and user engagement.  
**Example:** In a wireframe for a product page, the product image might be placed on the left, with the product title, description, and price aligned to the right for quick scanning.

### 4. Functionality
Functionality highlights interactive elements such as buttons, input fields, forms, and filters. These are represented simply in wireframes (e.g., boxes for buttons, lines for text fields).  
**Example:** A "Book Now" button in a booking system wireframe shows where users can take action, while form fields indicate where user input is required.

By clearly defining these elements, wireframes make it easier to test usability, gather feedback, and ensure that the final product aligns with both business goals and user needs.
